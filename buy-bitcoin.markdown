I am an occasional Bitcoin trader on various P2P platforms. You can buy Bitcoin with Euro or USD from me without going through KYC.

I use [BISQ](https://bisq.network/), [Paxful](https://paxful.com/user/ivopashov) and [LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/accounts/profile/btcivo/).

Bisq is best for privacy. However, you have to install software on your machine and liquidity is bad. Paxful and LocalBitcoins are not that private as there is an entity behind them but they are very user friendly and are web based.

I mainly trade BTC for EUR with Revolut and SEPA but do other currencies (GBP, USD) and other payment methods too (PayPal, Amazon gift cards etc.).

If neither offer suits you, write <a href="mailto:ivo.pashoff@gmail.com">me</a> and I can make one just for you on any of those platforms.
